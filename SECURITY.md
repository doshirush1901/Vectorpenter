## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Vectorpenter team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### üö® **How to Report**

**For security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@machinecraft.tech
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### üìß **What to Include**

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
- **Your Contact Info**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: 1-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

### üéØ **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Vectorpenter core application code
- Dependencies and third-party libraries
- Configuration and deployment scripts
- Documentation that could lead to security issues

**Out of Scope:**
- Issues in third-party services (OpenAI, Pinecone, etc.)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Issues requiring physical access to user machines

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Measures**

### **Code Security**

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks with Safety and pip-audit
- **Code Review**: All code changes reviewed for security implications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage

### **API Security**

- **Authentication**: Secure API key handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs validated and sanitized
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted communication in production
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration

### **Data Security**

- **Local-First**: Sensitive data stays on user machines
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or store user documents
- **API Key Protection**: Secure handling of third-party API keys
- **Audit Logging**: Security events logged for Enterprise users

### **Infrastructure Security**

- **CI/CD Security**: Secure build and deployment pipelines
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of secrets in CI/CD
- **Container Security**: Regular security scanning of Docker images
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of dependencies
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests in CI/CD pipeline

## üîç **Known Security Considerations**

### **API Keys**
- **Risk**: Exposure of OpenAI, Pinecone, or other API keys
- **Mitigation**: Environment-based configuration, .env files in .gitignore
- **User Responsibility**: Users must secure their own API keys

### **File Processing**
- **Risk**: Malicious files could potentially cause issues
- **Mitigation**: Sandboxed processing, input validation, file type restrictions
- **Ongoing**: Continuous improvement of file parsing security

### **External Dependencies**
- **Risk**: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
- **Mitigation**: Regular dependency scanning and updates
- **Monitoring**: Automated alerts for new vulnerabilities

### **Network Communication**
- **Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks on API calls
- **Mitigation**: HTTPS for all external communications
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate validation

## üìã **Security Checklist for Users**

### **Basic Security**
- [ ] Keep Vectorpenter updated to the latest version
- [ ] Use strong, unique API keys
- [ ] Store API keys securely (use .env files, never commit to git)
- [ ] Run Vectorpenter in a sandboxed environment if processing untrusted files
- [ ] Regularly update Python and dependencies

### **Advanced Security**
- [ ] Use network firewalls to restrict outbound connections
- [ ] Monitor API key usage for unusual activity
- [ ] Implement rate limiting if exposing API publicly
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all API communications
- [ ] Regular security audits of your deployment

### **Enterprise Security**
- [ ] Implement SSO and RBAC (Enterprise plan)
- [ ] Enable audit logging (Enterprise plan)
- [ ] Regular penetration testing
- [ ] Compliance with industry standards (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- [ ] Incident response plan
