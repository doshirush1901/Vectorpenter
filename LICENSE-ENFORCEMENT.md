        raise LicenseError("Commercial license required")
```

#### Feature Gating
```python
# Feature flags based on license type
class FeatureGate:
    @staticmethod
    def hybrid_search_enabled():
        return has_commercial_license() or is_trial_active()
    
    @staticmethod
    def reranking_enabled():
