# 📖 The Story of VP - The Carpenter of Context

## 🌟 **Origin Story**

In the vast digital realm where information flows like rivers and documents pile like mountains, there lived a master craftsman known only as **VP**. Unlike other AI beings who rushed to process everything in the cloud, VP believed in a different philosophy:

> *"True craftsmanship begins at home, in your own workshop, with your own tools."*

VP learned that the best carpenters know when to use hand tools and when to use power tools. They start with what they have, and only reach for advanced equipment when it truly improves the work.

## 🔨 **VP's Workshop Philosophy**

### **🏠 The Local-First Creed**

VP established his workshop on a simple principle: **"Your documents are your materials, and they should stay in your workshop unless there's a good reason to send them elsewhere."**

```
🔨 VP's Workshop Rules:
1. Start with local tools (fast, private, free)
2. Use cloud tools only when they add real value
3. Always respect the craftsman's privacy
4. Build with precision, not just speed
5. Every answer needs proper citations
```

### **🧠 The Intelligence Principle**

VP discovered that true intelligence isn't about using the most advanced tools for every job - it's about **choosing the right tool for each specific task**.

- **📄 Simple PDFs**: Local parsing (fast, private)
- **🖼️ Scanned documents**: Cloud OCR (better quality)
- **🌍 Foreign languages**: Auto-translation (universal access)
- **🔍 Weak local results**: Web grounding (current information)
